<div class="container">
    <div id="about" class="about-me">
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Joseph Noble but go by my middle name "Greg".
      I currently work for the University of Cincinnati Online as a Senior Website and CRM Manager. At UC Online, I am the technical lead for
      our University's CRM (formally Hubspot but now Salesforce), which means I build workflows, processses, bring in new technologies and integrations
      as well as work with SQL and Javascript throughout the day. I joined UC Online on January 01, 2019 as employee number 14. Since coming on, our org has grown to
      house right around 105 employees and a forecast of hiring 40 new people in the 2022 year. When not at work, I love to play with new technologies, go hiking, fishing and enjoy (attempting) to cook new recipes.

  <h3>Why You Should Hire Me</h3>
  <p>Outside of my resume, cover letter and reviews attached, I hope this website I created for RevPartners shows my passion,
    work ethic, and desire for this position. I can only imagine how many great applicants you are interviewing for this role,
    but what seperates me from the others are my values. I'm loyal, honest, adaptable, quick and open to learning, creative,
    passionate and have a positive get-it-done personality.
    If given the opportunity to work for RevPartners, I can ensure you that I will work hard each day to
    have earned the opportunity to work for you.
